# Input Code for Live 3D Interaction Plot
# Be sure that you have run the function code in this R session before running this input code.
# The plot will appear in the RStudio Viewer window.
# A copy will also be saved to your computer. 
# To publish the plot online, click the blue "Publish" button in the Viewer window. You will need to 
# make a free RPubs account. 

# Here is an input code example. Update the arguments in quotations and copy and paste it to run in R to produce a live plot

	y.var = "Depression.c", # Outcome variable. This should match the variable name in your dataset exactly, including capitalization.

	x1.var = "LifeStress.c", # X1 predictor variable. This should match the variable name in your dataset exactly, including capitalization.
	x1.name = "Life Stress", # Name of outcome variable to appear in plot. This name can be anything you want it to be. It will appear on the X/Z axis in the plot.
